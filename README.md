# PROJECT2_CO2

TOPIC
We want to explore climate change. Since 1970 CO2 emissions have increased ~90%, with fossil fuels the #1 source. Our group will examine fossil fuel generated CO2 emissions in the years leading up to the Paris Climate Accord (2015).


REPOSITORY

DATA SOURCE
Our data source is the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center - https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-by-nation.  The data is available both as .CSV and .JSON files.
•	https://github.com/datasets/co2-fossil-by-nation/blob/master/data/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-by-nation.csv 
•	https://datahub.io/core/co2-fossil-by-nation/r/fossil-fuel-co2-emissions-by-nation.json 

Our data set outlines: 
•	Annual fossil fuel generated CO2 emissions by country from 1751 (includes only a few countries) through 2014 (228 countries)
•	Data fields include year, country, total, solid, liquid fuel, gas fuel, cement, gas flaring, per capita, bunker fuels
●	solid fuel are emissions from coal
●	liquid fuel are emissions from petroleum-based fuels
●	gas fuels are emissions from natural gas
●	gas flaring are emissions tied to oil extraction
●	cement are emissions from production of concrete (currently ~7% of CO2 emissions)
●	bunker fuels are emissions from ships - note: not included in the emissions total


PART ONE: ETL
Our ETL goal is to simplify the dataset to streamline routes to answering our questions. We are considering:
●	Dropping bunker fuels (not included in total)
●	Using years 1970 – 2014 (CO2 emissions almost doubled from 1970-2014)
●	Focusing on top countries (the total of smaller countries is not significant) 
●	Breaking data into regions – e.g. Middle East 
●	Including data on domestic fossil fuel production, haven’t found a good source yet

●	https://www.fossilfuelsreview.ed.ac.uk/resources/Evidence%20-%20Climate%20Science/IEA%20-%20Key%20World%20Energy%20Statistics.pdf 


PART TWO: Coding
●	We will use JSON data as it’s becoming more commonplace in corporate settings
●	Our ETL process will be done in Jupyter Notebooks
●	Our filtered data will be stored in a SQL database based on a bespoke schema 
●	We’ll utilize Flask with HTML, CSS, graphics (Plotly and D3) to display our findings


PART THREE: Frontend and chart ideas under consideration based on findings
●	Total CO2 emissions 1970 - 2014 (line graph)
●	Countries - top 10 emitters and their % of the total over time (stacked bar)
●	Countries - per capita emissions (stacked bar by type of fuel used)
●	Global - current CO2 emissions (heatmap)
